# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use the Kickstarter data to analyze and visualize the Theater Campaigns Outcomes and how they fared in relation to their Launch Date and the Play Campaigns Funding Goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Kickstarter data were filtered by Theater as the parent category and its corresponding Launch Date Year. The values used were the different types of Outcomes: Successful, Failed, and Canceled. It was then grouped by the Months of the Year and Outcomes were sorted in descending order so "Successful" is first.

Here is the pivot table used for the analysis:

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
